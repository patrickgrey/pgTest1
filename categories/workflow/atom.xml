    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was using IETester which was fine for a while but would crash with the slightest problem on the page. At least this let me know something was wrong but not much help in debugging.</p>

<p>In the end I decided to go for a Virtual Machine (VM). I went to <a href="http://www.modern.ie/" title="A testing website for Internet Explorer">http://www.modern.ie/</a> and tried the Hyper-V machine for windows 8.Then discovered that it won&#39;t install on my laptop for some reason. I next tried <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org" title="Oracle Virtual Machine">VirtualBox</a> and it was successful. I had to install VirtualBox first and then run the Image exe provided by modern.ie but now I have a full IE8 running on XP (XP just for extra shit and giggles).</p>
